## My process

Started with mobile first. Used Sass to organize the CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

Finally learned how to use Sass variables. However, after some research on best practices, I will be going back to CSS custom properties.
Mobile first does allow you to focus on the styles without the layout getting in the way. And you can use partial on each section to get really granular. But too many partials and I lose track of the overall design.
Learned to use nesting, which is pretty cool.

### Continued development

Continueing the Sass journey. Want to balance out organizing the work and not too many partials. Next up: mixins!
